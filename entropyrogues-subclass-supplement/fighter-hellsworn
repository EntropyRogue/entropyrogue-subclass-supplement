			<p>Not all fighters gain their abilities through training alone-- the Hellsworn are wielders of a powerful item-- a weapon created by a greater devil of the Nine Hells. While this tool gives the user infernal powers, it also grants its fiendish creator the ability to psychically communicate with the user and see through their eyes.</p>
			<p>Hellsworn are not necessarily evil; many will view the devil's presense as a nuisance, but are unable to rid themselves of the cursed item. Others, however, may embrace the devil, and willingly perform their bidding.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a cursed magical weapon smithed by a greater devil. It can take the form of any 2-handed melee weapon in the Player's Handbook, and acts as a +1 weapon of that type. It is always attuned to you, but does not require an attunement slot.</p>
			<p class= "indent">While the fiendish weapon is on your person, its creator-- a greater devil-- can psychically communicate with you, and is able to experience any senses you do. Nobody other than you can hear the devil, or what you say to them.</p>
			<p class= "indent">If your fiendish weapon travels farther than 5 feet away from you, it will dissipate and immediately reconstitute on your person.</p>
			<p class= "indent">The magic bonus of your Fiendish Weapon increases to +2 at level 10, and +3 at level 18.</p>

			<p>At 7th level, your fiendish weapon hungers for power from other weapons. During a long rest, you can use your fiendish weapon, another magic weapon, and 50 gold in incense, to perform a ritual-- during which the magic item and incense are consumed in a bright flame, and your fiendish weapon gains the consumed weapon's power.</p>
<p class= "indent">After you perform this ritual, your fiendish weapon has the same damage, magic effects, and attunement requirements as the consumed item, but retains its form, as well as the 2-handed property.</p>
<p class= "indent">Performing this ritual again causes your fiendish weapon to replace the damage, magic effects, and attunement requirements of the previous item in exchange for the new one.</p>
